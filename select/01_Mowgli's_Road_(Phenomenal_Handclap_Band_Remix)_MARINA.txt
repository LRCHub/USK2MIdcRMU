Ten silver spoons coming after me.
One life with one dream on repeat.
I'll escape if I try hard enough.
'Til, King of the Jungle calls my bluff.

(Oh Lord) Oh Lord,
I have been told, (I have been told).
That I must take, the unforsaken road.

(Forsaken road).

There's a fork in the road,
I'll do as I am told,
And I don't know, don't know, don't know, don't know,
Who I want to be.

You say Y-E-S to everything,
Will that guarantee you a win?
Do you think you will be good enough,
To love others and to be l-l-l-l-loved?

(Oh Lord) Oh Lord,
Now I can see, (now I can see).
The cutlery will keep on chasing me.

(Forsaken road).

There's a fork in the road,
I'll do as I am told,
And I don't know, don't know, don't know, don't know,
Who I want to be.

"We are the spoons," they're telling me,
"We scooped our way into your dreams,
To knock the knives out bloody cold,
And lead you down the unforsaken road."

(Forsaken road)

There's a fork in the road,
I'll do as I am told,
And I don't know, don't know, don't know, don't know,
Who I want to be.

Cuckoo.
